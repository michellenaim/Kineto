## Background

Kineto is a full stack web application inspired by Netflix. It is a streaming service that allows people to watch movie trailers on-demand. Users can sign up by creating an account, sign in if they already have one or use a demo user to browse the videos on the web application. On the movie trailers index page (/browse), users can view one main movie trailer as well as movie trailers separated by genre. Users can also go to each genre's show page to view movie trailers per genre.

In the backend, Kineto was built using a Ruby on Rails framework. In terms of database, PostgreSQL was used to store data along with Amazon AWS S3 and Active Storage to store the movie trailer thumbnails and videos. In the frontend, React and Redux were used to create a single-page web application to enable smooth navigation for users.

The future directions for Kineto are to enable users to view the movie trailers filtered by genre in a carousel, add movie trailers to their list as well as search for a specific movie trailer or genre.
